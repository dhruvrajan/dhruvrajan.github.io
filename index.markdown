# Dhruv Rajan’s Performance Setlist

Instruments: Guitar, Banjo, Octave Mandolin, Flute

I’m hoping to perform the setlists below on solo guitar and banjo, perhaps at coffee shops or at farmers markets. These are solo arrangements of classic acoustic rock / folk songs, largely from the 70’s (Cat Stevens, Jethro Tull, Nic Jones), with some more recent selections (Tallest Man on Earth, Mumford and Sons).

I’ve linked recordings below in both video (YouTube) and audio (SoundCloud) format. Some of the SoundCloud recordings have multiple tracks and instruments, but I will be playing solo, so the videos are a more accurate representation of the performance.

I’m happy to work with you to restructure this setlist if helpful, add / remove songs to fit the performance better! Please let me know any thoughts you have to help me prepare for an enjoyable performance.
