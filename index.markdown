Hi! My name is Dhruv Rajan. I'm an avid guitarist and multi-instrumenetalist (if only, by moonlight) living in the Bay Area, CA. I perform solo on guitar, clawhammer banjo, octave mandolin, and vocals, and would love to discuss opportunities to perform at coffee shops, farmers and other events.

I mainly play arrangements of classic acoustic rock and folk songs, particuarly from the 70’s (Cat Stevens, Jethro Tull, Nic Jones), along with some more recent selections like Tallest Man on Earth, and Mumford and Sons.

For examples of my playing, please check out my [setlist recordings](/pages/setlists.html).

I’m always happy to tailor my setlist to fit the environment best! Please let me know any thoughts you might have to prepare for an enjoyable performance.

**Contact me:**
