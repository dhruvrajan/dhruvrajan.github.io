/Guitar, Banjo, Octave Mandolin, Flute/

---

Hi! I perform solo guitar, banjo, and octave mandolin at coffee shops, farmers markets, and other events. Largely, I play arrangements of classic acoustic rock / folk songs, particuarly from the 70’s (Cat Stevens, Jethro Tull, Nic Jones), along with some more recent selections (Tallest Man on Earth, Mumford and Sons). I'd love to chat about any opportunities to play this music!

I’ve linked recordings of my [setlists](/pages/setlists.html) in both video ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa_LjjQKzbIQUqj-WOH1m7Q)) and audio ([SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/dhruv-rajan)) format. Some of the SoundCloud recordings have multiple tracks and instruments, but I will be playing solo, so the videos are a more accurate representation of the performance.

I’d be happy to work with you to restructure this setlist if helpful, add / remove songs to fit a performance better! Please let me know any thoughts you have to help me prepare for an enjoyable performance.
